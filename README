Algorithm/Huffman version 0.06
==============================

SYNOPSIS

  use Algorithm::Huffman;

  my %char_counting = map {$_ => int rand(100)} ('a' .. 'z', 'A' .. 'Z');
  # or better the real counting for your characters
  # as the huffman algorithm doesn't work good with random data :-)) 
 
  my $huff = Algorithm::Huffman->new(\%char_counting);
  my $encode_hash = $huff->encode_hash;
  my $decode_hash = $huff->decode_hash;
  
  print "Look at the encoding bitstring of 'Hello': ", 
        $huff->encode_bitstring("Hello");
        
  print "The decoding of 110011001 is ", $huff->decode_bitstring("110011001");
