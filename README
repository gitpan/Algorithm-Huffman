Algorithm/Huffman version 0.08
==============================

SYNOPSIS

  use Algorithm::Huffman;

  my %char_counting = map {$_ => int rand(100)} ('a' .. 'z', 'A' .. 'Z');
  # or better the real counting for your characters
  # as the huffman algorithm doesn't work good with random data :-)) 

  my $huff = Algorithm::Huffman->new(\%char_counting);
  my $encode_hash = $huff->encode_hash;
  my $decode_hash = $huff->decode_hash;

  my $encode_of_hello = $huff->encode_bitstring("Hello");

  print "Look at the encoding bitstring of 'Hello': $encode_of_hello\n";
  print "The decoding of $encode_of_hello is '", $huff->decode_bitstring($encode_of_hello), "'";
